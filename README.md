# RoboTech Challenge 2024 Code

This repository contains both the Python server and the UR3e client program for communication and challenge behavior computations.

## Run the server

To run the python server: 

```shell
python3 python/robotech.py {run, cmd}
```

There are actually two options to run the server:

- **run** to run the sequencer
- **cmd** to open a console to speak directly with the UR3e client
